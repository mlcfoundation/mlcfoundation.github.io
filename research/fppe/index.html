<p><a href="https://share.streamlit.io/mlcfoundation/fppe/main/app.py"><strong>Family Planning Performance Explorer</strong></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Family Planning Performance Explorer</strong> provides estimates of 21 family planning performance indicators for India and for its constituent states/Union Territories and districts derived from the data available from the National Family Health Survey 2015-2016 and 2019-2021. The explorer covers the folowing aspects of family planning performance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Family planning methods prevalence</p>
<p>1.1 Prevalence of all methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years currently using any family planning method)</p>
<p>1.2 Prevalence of modern methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years currently using a modern family planning method)</p>
<p>1.3 Prevalence of traditional methods ((Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years or their husband using a traditional family planning method)</p>
<p>1.4 Prevalence of female sterilisation (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years sterilised)</p>
<p>1.5 Prevalence of male sterilisation (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose husband is sterilised)</p>
<p>1.6 Prevalence of IUD (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years using an intra-uterine device)</p>
<p>1.7 Prevalence of oral pill (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years using oral pill)</p>
<p>1.8 Prevalence of condom (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose husband is using condom)</p>
<p>1.9 Prevalence of injectables (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years using injectables)</p>
<p>1.10 Prevalence of other modern methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years or their husband using other modern methods) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Met demand of modern family planning methods</p>
<p>2.1 Met demand of modern family planning methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose family planning demand is satisfied by modern family planning methods)</p>
<p>2.2 Met demand of permanent family planning methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose demand for permanent methods is satisfied)</p>
<p>2.3 Met demand of modern spacing methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose demand for modern spacing methods is satisfied)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unmet need of family planning
    3.1 Total unmet need for family planning</p>
<p>3.2 Unmet need for limiting births</p>
<p>3.3 Unmet for spacing births</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family planning method mix</p>
<p>4.1 50 percent rule (Proportion of total family planning use accounted by a single method). (United Nations, 2013).</p>
<p>4.2 Method skew index. The index ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the method skew index, the higher the skewness in family planning method mix. (Chaurasia, 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family Planning quality</p>
<p>5.1 Health worker ever talked to non-users about family planning (Per cent of currently married women aged 15-49 years not using any family planning method reported that the health worker talked about family planning)</p>
<p>5.2 Current users told about side-effects (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years who or whose husband were using a family planning method were told about the side effects of the method)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family planning performance</p>
<p>6.1 Family planning performance index. The index ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the index the better the family planning performance. (Chaurasia, 2022)</p>
</li>
