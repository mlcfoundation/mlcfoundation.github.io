<p>The <strong>Family Planning Performance Explorer</strong> provides estimates of 21 family planning performance indicators for India and for its constituent states/Union Territories and districts derived from the data available from the National Family Health Survey 2015-2016 and 2019-2021. The explorer covers the folowing aspects of family planning performance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Family planning methods prevalence<ol>
<li>Prevalence of all methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years currently using any family planning method)</li>
<li>Prevalence of modern methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years currently using a modern family planning method)</li>
<li>Prevalence of traditional methods ((Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years or their husband using a traditional family planning method)</li>
<li>Prevalence of female sterilisation (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years sterilised)</li>
<li>Prevalence of male sterilisation (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose husband is sterilised)</li>
<li>Prevalence of IUD (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years using an intra-uterine device)</li>
<li>Prevalence of oral pill (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years using oral pill)</li>
<li>Prevalence of condom (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose husband is using condom</li>
<li>Prevalence of injectables (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years using injectables)</li>
<li>Prevalence of other modern methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years or their husband using other modern methods)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Met demand of modern family planning methods<ol>
<li>Met demand of modern family planning methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose family planning demand is satisfied by modern family planning methods)</li>
<li>Met demand of permanent family planning methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose demand for permanent methods is satisfied)</li>
<li>Met demand of modern spacing methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose demand for modern spacing methods is satisfied)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Unmet need of family planning<ol>
<li>Total unmet need for family planning</li>
<li>Unmet need for limiting births</li>
<li>Unmet for spacing births</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Family planning method mix<ol>
<li>50 percent rule (Proportion of total family planning use accounted by a single method). (United Nations, 2013).</li>
<li>Method skew index. The index ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the method skew index, the higher the skewness in family planning method mix. (Chaurasia, 2021).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Family Planning quality<ol>
<li>Health worker ever talked to non-users about family planning (Per cent of currently married women aged 15-49 years not using any family planning method reported that the health worker talked about family planning)</li>
<li>Current users told about side-effects (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years who or whose husband were using a family planning method were told about the side effects of the method)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Family planning performance<ol>
<li>Family planning performance index. The index ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the index the better the family planning performance. (Chaurasia, 2022)</li>
