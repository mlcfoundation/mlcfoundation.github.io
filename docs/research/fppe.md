The **Family Planning Performance Explorer** provides estimates of 21 family planning performance indicators for India and for its constituent states/Union Territories and districts derived from the data available from the National Family Health Survey 2015-2016 and 2019-2021. The explorer covers the folowing aspects of family planning performance:

1. Family planning methods prevalence

    1.1 Prevalence of all methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years currently using any family planning method)

    1.2 Prevalence of modern methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years currently using a modern family planning method)

    1.3 Prevalence of traditional methods ((Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years or their husband using a traditional family planning method)

    1.4 Prevalence of female sterilisation (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years sterilised)

    1.5 Prevalence of male sterilisation (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose husband is sterilised)

    1.6 Prevalence of IUD (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years using an intra-uterine device)

    1.7 Prevalence of oral pill (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years using oral pill)

    1.8 Prevalence of condom (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose husband is using condom)

    1.9 Prevalence of injectables (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years using injectables)

    1.10 Prevalence of other modern methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years or their husband using other modern methods) 

2. Met demand of modern family planning methods

    2.1 Met demand of modern family planning methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose family planning demand is satisfied by modern family planning methods)

    2.2 Met demand of permanent family planning methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose demand for permanent methods is satisfied)

    2.3 Met demand of modern spacing methods (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years whose demand for modern spacing methods is satisfied)

3. Unmet need of family planning
    3.1 Total unmet need for family planning

    3.2 Unmet need for limiting births

    3.3 Unmet for spacing births

4. Family planning method mix

    4.1 50 percent rule (Proportion of total family planning use accounted by a single method). (United Nations, 2013).

    4.2 Method skew index. The index ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the method skew index, the higher the skewness in family planning method mix. (Chaurasia, 2021).

5. Family Planning quality

    5.1 Health worker ever talked to non-users about family planning (Per cent of currently married women aged 15-49 years not using any family planning method reported that the health worker talked about family planning)

    5.2 Current users told about side-effects (Percent of currently married women aged 15-49 years who or whose husband were using a family planning method were told about the side effects of the method)

6. Family planning performance
