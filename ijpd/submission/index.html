    <h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>Original research papers may be submitted for publication in the <strong>INDIAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION AND
DEVELOPMENT</strong> to the Managing Editor through e-mail ijpd@mlcfoundation.org.in.</p>
<p>Research papers must be submitted in MS WORD format and should not be submitted in pdf format or in any other format.</p>
<p>The first page of the manuscript submitted to the <strong>INDIAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT</strong> for publication must be the title page. The title page of the manuscript must contain the following information only:</p>
<p>a. Title of the paper
b. Names of all authors with their institutional affiliation and e-mail address
c. Name of the corresponding author
d. Complete address of the corresponding author
e. Telephone number of the corresponding author
f. E-mail of the corresponding author
g. Statement about conflict of interest
h. Statement about funding source if any
i. Acknowledgement(s), if any.</p>
<p>The name of author(s) and their identity must be given in the title page only. The name of author(s) and their identity must not be mentioned in any form in rest of the paper to reveal the identity of author(s) in any form to facilitate the blind review process. Research papers submitted to the <strong>INDIAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT</strong> for publication should be arranged in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The abstract of the paper must not be more than 500 words. It should contain the objective of the research, data source, methods adopted, key findings and their policy relevance. Papers having abstract of more than 500 words will be returned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Introduction should be concise. It should cite the relevant literature and explain how the current research adds to the existing evidence and knowledge. Unpublished research findings and personal communications must not be cited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>: Objectives of the paper must be clear and crisp. They must describe how the paper contributes to the existing knowledge and the limitations of the research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Source</strong>: The source of the data used in the analysis must be clearly mentioned. If the paper is based on primary data, details of the data collection design including the sampling frame, sample size, sampling scheme used to select the sample, method of collecting data, should be adequately elaborated
to ascertain the quality of data. It is understood that all data used in the analysis will be made available for other researchers for the purposes of reproducing or extending the analysis. If secondary data are used, then full details of the source must be given along with the limitations of the data. All variables used in the analysis must be clearly defined along with the source of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>: The analytical and statistical methods used in the research paper should be sufficiently detailed including the assumptions made to clearly understand the analytical and statistical context of the research paper. Any software used for analysing the data must be clearly specified. Descriptive statistics should invariably be presented for variables that are integral to subsequent analyses and interpretation of the study findings. All equations must be typed in the text using equation editor and must not be placed as images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>: Findings must be to the point and there should be no repetition. Data presented in tables and figures should not described again in the text. Rather, main observations derived from the tables and figures should be presented. Only those findings should be presented as findings which have relevance to the objectives of the research paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong>: Discussion should be specific to the findings of the analysis relevant to the objectives of the research paper and should be supported by citing relevant studies. In situations where findings are contrary to the existing evidence, full explanation or justification of the findings must be provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Conclusion must be compact and should reflect the contribution of the paper to the existing knowledge and the knowledge gap addressed by the paper. Conclusions may also highlight the policy and programme relevance of the analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>References</strong>: References should be organised alphabetically at the end of the paper and must follow the reference style of the <strong>INDIAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tables, charts, diagrams, and figures should be placed at the end of the research paper, one table or chart or diagram or figure per page. Every table, chart, diagram, and figure must be serially numbered and must have self-explaining heading and source. Every table, chart, diagram, and figure must have citation in the text. Tables, charts, diagrams, and figures which are not cited in the text must not be included in the paper.</p>
<p>All tables must be presented in the table format and must not be presented as figure format. All figures and diagrams included in the paper must be in JPEG format.</p>
<p>If the paper is accepted for publication in the <strong>INDIAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT</strong>, the author(s) will have to provide the data used in the construction of charts and diagrams in Excel sheet.</p>
